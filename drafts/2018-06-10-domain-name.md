title: The permutationlock domain

The domain name "permutation lock" is something that I came up with back in
high school when I learned that the locking mechanism on a "combination lock"
does not fit with the combinatorial notion of a combination.

Unfortunately for
high school me, combination locks aren't generally permutation locks either
since repeat numbers are allowed. The name
"function-between-finite-sets lock" doesn't roll off of the tongue quite as
well though.
