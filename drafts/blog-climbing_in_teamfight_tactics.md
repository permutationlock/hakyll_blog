I recently achieved the rank of masters in Teamfight Tactics (TFT) with 150
games played this season. This places me currently in the top two thousand
players, out of over one million, and thus around the top 0.01%.
I played League of Legends obsessively from season one through
season four, with my rank peaking at platinum. Thus achieving masters rank in a
Riot game, or any game for that matter, was something I never thought I would
be able to achieve; especially because I have significantly cut back on the
amount of time
I spend on video games. During the years of 2015-2019 I played hardly
any video games at all. In fact, the only time I recall playing any game for
more than a couple hours
was during a few weeks I had off of grad school that I spent unhappily spamming online
chess games.

Nevertheless, I have always sought to excel at something, to be a part of an
elite community. The desire to stand out for excellence drove me grind League
and Hearthstone,
pushed me to study chess, and also formed my core motivation to pursue math
grad school. I never quite had what it takes however. In math I grew
frustrated with how isolating the work is, especially when I cared more for
demonstrating my problem solving prowess than for the problems I was solving.
Grad school became miserable for me as I found myself in a situation where
I had no way to satisfy my competitive attitude towards academia.
I wanted to solve Hartshorne exercises,
and complete other supposedly difficult tasks with clear demonstrable goals.
Meanwhile, I found that I had little
interest in slowly researching my thesis question: there was no one to directly
compete with and also no one show off to other than my advisor. I will not
pretend that this excuses my failure, or that this is the sole reason that I
abandoned my study of mathematics (I began suffering from
panic/anxiety/hypochondria attacks that made living alone in Vancouver
untenable),
but it is how I currently rationalize my loss of interest in something that
formed a core part of my life for the better part of five years.

Abandoning my dreams of a PhD and a career in math this past summer left me
with no direct goals and no self worth. Unemployed, living at home, with no
social interaction during the pandemic, I have been quite lost for the past
several months. Achieving Masters in TFT has given a taste of
accomplishing excellence, and reignited my belief that I can achieve anything
if I find the dedication.
