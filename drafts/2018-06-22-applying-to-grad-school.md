I have spent a lot of time applying to grad schools, here are some useful
things that I found during my search.

### School Selection

Ways to find schools:

 - Talk to people
 - See where grant money is going from [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/), [NSERC](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/ase-oro/index_eng.asp), etc.
 - Look where cool people have worked or done PhDs
 - [US News Rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/mathematics-rankings)
 - [Number Theory Web](http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/N2.html)
 - [Math GRE Forum](http://www.mathematicsgre.com)
 - [Mathjobs (for some fellowships)](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs)

The [Math GRE Forum](http://www.mathematicsgre.com) is a good resource
for estimating the relative competetiveness of schools. More data is also
available from the
[Grad Cafe](https://thegradcafe.com/survey/index.php?q=math*&t=a&o=&pp=100).

Another thing that you might want to keep in mind is that different
countries distribute grant money
in different ways. For example, the
[NSERC award list](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/ase-oro/index_eng.asp) shows
that almost every Canadian professor holds a yearly discovery grant, while
the grants on the [NSF award list](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/) tend to be
larger and more sparsely distributed.

### The Math Subject GRE

Unfortunately the subject GRE is required to apply to US grad schools. A score
of 80th percentile or better is generally considered optimal in that schools
don't tend to differentiate between GRE scores beyond that point. Good resources
to study for the test are the Princeton Review book and the [available practice
tests](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~chparkin/gre.html).
