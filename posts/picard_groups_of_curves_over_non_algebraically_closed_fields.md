If $C$ is a curve defined over a field $k$ we generally define the divisor
group of $C$, denoted $\text{Div}(C)$,
as the free abelian group generated by points in
$C(\overline{k})$. We then define the principal divisors as the subgroup
$\text{Prin}(C)$ of
$\text{Div}(C)$ consisting of all divisors of the form $\text{div}(f)=
\sum_{P\in C(\overline{k})}\text{ord}_P(f)$ with $f\in\overline{k}(C)^*$. We then
define the Picard group $\text{Pic}(C)=\text{Div}(C)/\text{Prin}(C)$.

Given a divisor $D=\sum n_P(P)\in\text{Div}(C)$ and an automorphism $\sigma\in\text{Gal}(
\overline{k}/k)$ we define $\sigma(D)=\sum n_P(P^{\sigma}).$
We say that a divisor $D\in\text{Div}(C)$ is defined over $k$, denoted $D\in
\text{Div}_k(C)$, if $\sigma(D)=D$ for all
$\sigma\in\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k).$ We can then similarly define
$\text{Pic}_k(C)$ to be the set of classes of $\text{Pic}(C)$ that are
invariant under every element of $\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k).$

From the above definitions we have the following exact sequence
$$
    0\to \overline{k}^*\to\overline{k}(C)^*\to\text{Div}^0(C)
    \to\text{Pic}^0(C)^*\to 0.
$$
We would hope to have another exact sequence for the corresponding objects
defined over $k$. In fact we will show that we always have an exact squence
$$
    0\to k^*\to k(C)^*\to\text{Div}_k^0(C)\to\text{Pic}^0_k(C).
$$
It is immediate that the above sequence is exact at $k^*$ and $k(C)^*$, but it is
surprisingly non-elementary to observe that the sequence is exact at
$\text{Div}_K^0$. In order to show that the sequence is exact at $\text{Div}_K^0$
we need to show that if $\text{div}(f)\in\text{Div}_k$ for some
$f\in\overline{k}(C)^*$, then $\text{div}(f)=\text{div}(g)$ for some $g\in k(C)^*$.
That is, we need to show that we have the following short exact sequence:
$$
    0\to k^*\to k(C)^*\to\text{Prin}_k(C)\to 0
$$
where $\text{Prin}_k(C)$ is the subset of Galois invariant divisors in
$\text{Prin}(C)$.
This is precisely the situation that is studied by
[Galois cohomology](/notes/galois_cohomology.html).
We have $\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$-modules $k^*,k(C)^*,\text{Prin}(C)$,
and a short exact sequence
$$
    0\to \overline{k}^*\to\overline{k}(C)^*\to\text{Prin}(C)\to 0,
$$
and we wish to know if exactness holds once consider only the submodules
invariant under $\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$. Galois cohomology, or more
generally group cohomology, provides a long exact sequence
$$
    0\to k^*\to k(C)^*\to\text{Prin}_k(C)\to H^1(\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k),k^*).
$$
Finally, the cohomological version of
[Hilbert's Theorem 90](/notes/hilbert_90.html)
tells us that $H^1(\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k),k^*)=0$.

The inspiration for this problem comes from Silverman (1, Exercise 2.13).
