Palm Springs is a movie that feels very familiar, and yet I can't quite put my
finger on any movie that matches the experience. Unsurprisingly, the
first comparison that jumps to mind is the Netflix series Russian Doll: both deal with
characters stuck in a time loop, and the characters have similar
attitudes towards their situation. However, Palm Springs leans more towards
romance than Russian doll does, and it has a distinct atmosphere.

Palm
Springs evokes the feeling of a one-off episode of a television show (e.g. Buffy)
where the characters are thrown into an odd fantastical situation and must
emotionally come to terms with their predicament while finding creative solutions
to the problems presented in their new universe. It also shares elements with
Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind in that it examines relationships through the lens of a
supernatural phenomena.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Palm Springs, and I would recommend it
to anyone who enjoyed one of the films or shows I mentioned above. 
It's also worth noting that Christin Milloti's character Sarah strongly resembles
the character that she played on Black Mirror; so if you enjoyed that particular
episode, you'll probably like some aspects of Palm Springs.
