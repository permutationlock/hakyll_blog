Rating: Amazing

The plot of Whisper of the Heart is quite simple and spelled out in any blurb
describing the movie: a girl notices each book she checks out of the library
has been checked out by the same boy, so she goes in search of her mysterious
reading mate. However, the movie is expert in the way that in just two short
hours it develops the characters of Shizuku's world in West Tokyo to a depth
rarely found in long running television shows.

Although the events of the movie are fairly mundane, the characters are
so likeable that the movie feels anything but. The film reminds of In This
Corner of the World since both movies blend the main character's artwork
directly into their animation.

The atmosphere and characters
remind me of Little Women (the musical or book, not the most recent movie).
Shizuku, like Jo, shirks the confines of gender roles and is quite fiery and
ambitious. Shizku and Jo also share the goal of becoming fiction authors.

I loved this movie and I would recommend it to anyone. Put it at the top of
your list if you are a fan of Miyazaki's other movies or if you enjoyed
Little Women, In This Corner of the World, or Five
Centimeters Per Second.
