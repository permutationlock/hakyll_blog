**2.1.** Let $\varphi:A\to A_f$ be the natural homomorphism given by $a\mapsto
a/1.$ Observe that $\varphi$ induces a bijection between the ideals of $A$ not
containing $f$ and the ideals of $A_f$ via the identification
$\mathfrak{a}\mapsto\varphi(\mathfrak{a})A_f$ with inverse
$\mathfrak{b}\mapsto\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{b}).$ This identification also
identifies prime ideals with prime ideals and therefore defines a bijection
$\psi:D(f)\to\text{Spec}(A_f)$. Moreover, by our observations above,
$\psi$ and $\psi^{-1}$ each send closed sets to closed sets. Hence $\psi$ is a
homeomorphism.

It remains to show that we have a morphism
$\psi^{\#}:\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(A_f)}\to\psi_*\mathscr{O}_X|_{D(f)}.$
Observe
that for $g/f^{n}\in A_f$ the set $D(g/f^{n})\subset\text{Spec}(A_f)$ is
equal to $D(g/1)\subset\text{Spec}(A_f)$ and $(A_{f})_{g/f^n}\cong A_{fg}.$
Note $D(g/1)=D(f)$ if $g\in (f).$
The basic open sets of $D(f)$ are precisely the sets $D(g)\cap D(f)$
for $g\in A$ and $D(g)\cap D(f)=D(f)$ when
$g\in (f).$ Thus $\psi$ identifies the basic open sets of $D(f)$ with the basic
open sets of $\text{Spec}(A_f).$ Moreover,
$$
    \mathscr{O}_X|_{D(f)}(D(g))\cong
    A_{fg}\cong\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(A_f)}(D(g/1))
$$
and these isomorphisms are
uniquely determined from the natural isomorphism
$\Gamma(D(f),\mathscr{O}_X|_{D(f)})\cong
\Gamma(\text{Spec}(A_f),\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(A_f)}.$ These isomorphisms
define
$$
    \psi^{\#}(D(g)):\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(A_f)}(D(g/1))\to
    \psi_*(\mathscr{O}_X|_{D(f)})(D(g/1)=\mathscr{O}_X|_{D(f)}(D(g))
$$
and
thus they glue to define $\psi^{\#}(U)$ for all open sets. Since each is an
isomorphism, $\psi^{\#}_{\mathfrak{a}}$ is clearly a local homomorphism of local
rings for each $\mathfrak{a}\in\text{Spec}(A_f).$

**2.2.** Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an affine open cover for $X$
with $U_\alpha\cong\text{Spec}(A^\alpha).$ Observe that
$U\cap U_\alpha$ is an open subset of $U_\alpha$ and hence $U\cap
U_\alpha=\bigcup_{\beta} U_{\alpha,\beta}$ such that for each $\beta$ we have
$U_{\alpha,\beta}\cong D(f_{\alpha,\beta})\subseteq\text{Spec}(A_{f_\alpha})$
with $f_{\alpha,\beta}\in A^\alpha.$ From proposition 2.2 we know
$D(f_{\alpha,\beta})\cong\text{Spec}(A^\alpha_{f_{\alpha,\beta}}).$
Therefore $U=\bigcup_{\alpha,\beta}U_{\alpha,\beta}$ and $\{U_{\alpha,\beta}\}$
is an affine open cover of $U.$ Therefore $(U,\mathscr{O}_X|_U)$ is a scheme.

**Lemma 1.** Suppose that $X$ is a topological space, $\mathscr{P}$ is a
presheaf on $X$, $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology on $X$, and
$\mathscr{P}$ is a $\mathcal{B}$-sheaf. Then $\mathscr{P}^{+}$ is isomorphic to
the sheaf generated by $\mathscr{P}$ as a $\mathcal{B}$-sheaf.
See Eisenbud proposition I-12 and [exercise I-13](/notes/eisenbud_harris.html)
for information on
$\mathcal{B}$-sheaves.

<div class="proof">
It suffices to observe that $f(B):\mathscr{P}(B)\to\mathscr{P}^{+}(B)$ is an
isomorphism for each set $B\in\mathcal{B}.$ Clearly the map $f(B)$ is
surjective for each $B\in\mathcal{B}$ by definition and it
is given by mapping a section
$s\in\mathscr{P}(B)$ to the function $B\to\bigsqcup_{P\in B}\mathscr{P}_P$
given by $P\mapsto s_P$ (see proposition 1.2).

It remains to show that $f(B)$ is injective for each $B.$ Suppose that
$s,t\in\mathscr{P}(B)$ are such that $f(B)(s)=f(B)(t).$ Then $s_P=t_P$ for all
$P\in B.$ Thus for each $P\in B$ there exists an open set $U_P\subset B$
containing $P$ such that $s|_{U_P}=t|_{U_P}.$ Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis, we may
pic a basis set $B_P\subset U_P$ containing $P.$ Therefore for each $P\in B$
there exists a basic open set $B_P\in\mathcal{B}$ containing $P$ such that
$s|_{B_P}=t|_{B_P}.$ Therefore $s=t$ since $\mathscr{P}$ is a
$\mathcal{B}$-sheaf.
</div>

**Corollary 2.** Suppose that $X$ is a topological space, $\mathscr{F}$ is a sheaf on
$X,$ and $\mathscr{P}$ is a presheaf on $X$ that forms a $\mathcal{B}$-sheaf on
some basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $X.$ If $f:\mathscr{P}\to\mathscr{F}$ is a map
of $\mathcal{B}$-sheaves (i.e. a collection of maps $f(B)$ for each
$B\in\mathcal{B},$
compatible with restrictions) such that $f(B)$ is an isomorphism for each
$B\in\mathcal{B},$
then there exists a induced map $\mathscr{P}^{+}\to\mathscr{F}$ that is
an isomorphism of
sheaves.

<div class="proof">
Recall that it suffices to define a map of sheaves on a basis. In our
case we have a basis
$\mathcal{B}$ and a collection of compatible isomorphisms
$f(B):\mathscr{P}^{+}(B)\to\mathscr{F}(B)$ for each
$B\in\mathcal{B},$ and therefore define an isomorphism of sheaves
$\mathscr{P}^{+}\to\mathscr{F}.$
</div>

**Lemma 3.** Suppose that $g:\mathscr{F}\to\mathscr{G}$ and
$h:\mathscr{F}\to\mathscr{H}$ are morphisms of sheaves such that $h$ is
surjective and
$\text{ker}(h)\subseteq\text{ker}(g).$ Then there exists a unique map of
sheaves $f:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{G}$ such that $g=f\circ h.$

<div class="proof">
Observe that by
exercise 1.7a we have that
$\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(g)\cong\text{im}(g)\subseteq\mathscr{G}$ and
$\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(h)\cong\mathscr{H}.$ Let
$i_1:(\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(g))^{\text{pre}}
\to\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(g)$ and
$i_2:(\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(h))^{\text{pre}}
\to\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(h)$ be the natural maps from each presheaf kernel to
the corresponding kernel sheaf. Finally, let $h':\mathscr{F}\to
(\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(g))^{\text{pre}}$ be the intermediate map to the
quotient sheaf.
Since $\text{ker}(h)(U)\subseteq\text{ker}(g)(U)$ for each open set $U,$
there clearly exists a
map of presheaves
$f':(\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(h))^{\text{pre}}
\to(\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(g))^{\text{pre}}$
such that $g=i_1 \circ f'\circ h'.$ By the universal property of
sheafification, there exists a map
$f:\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(h)\to\mathscr{F}/\text{ker}(g)$ such that
$f\circ i_2=i_1\circ f'.$ Therefore $g=f\circ i_2\circ h'=f\circ h.$
</div>

**2.3.a.** Suppose that $U\subseteq X$ is open and $s\in\mathcal{O}_X(U).$
If $s^n=0$ then $s_P^n=0$ for each $P\in U.$ Conversely, if $s_P^n=0$ for some
$P\in U$ then there exists an open neighborhood $V\subseteq U$ such that
$(s|_V)^n=0.$ Therefore a nilpotent section over an open subset exists if and
only if a nilpotent germ exists at a stalk.

**2.3.b.** Let us first show that for any ring $A$ we have
$(\text{Spec}(A))_{red}\cong
\text{Spec}(A_{\text{red}}).$ Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the nilradical of $A$ and
recall that $\mathcal{R}$ is the intersection of all the prime ideals of $A.$
Thus $\mathcal{R}$ is the unique prime ideal contained in all other prime
ideals and if $\mathcal{R}\ne (0)$ then $(0)$ Is not prime.
So natural map $\varphi:A\to A/\mathcal{R}=A_{\text{red}}$ gives a
bijection between the prime ideals of $A.$ By proposition 2.3c we have a map
$f:\text{Spec}(A/\mathcal{R})\to\text{Spec}(A)$ given by
$f(\mathfrak{p})=\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})$ and
$f^{\#}:\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)}\to
f_*\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A/\mathcal{R})}$ given by localizing $\varphi.$
We also know that
$f(V(\mathfrak{a}))=V(\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{a})).$ Thus $f$ is a homeomorphism
by our observations about the relationship between the ideals of $A$ and
$A/\mathcal{R}.$ For each
$D(g)\subset \text{Spec}(A)$ we have
$f^{\#}(D(g)):A_g\to (A/\mathcal{R})_{\varphi(g)}$ and
$(A/\mathcal{R})_{\varphi(g)}=(A_g)_{\text{red}}.$ Thus
$f_*\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A/\mathcal{R})}(D(f))\cong
\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)}(D(f))_{\text{red}}.$

Now let $(\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)})_{\text{red}}$ be the presheaf given by
$U\mapsto \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)}(U)_{\text{red}}.$ The
restriction maps $(\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)})_{\text{red}}(D(f))
\to(\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)})_{\text{red}}(D(g))$,
that is $(A_{f})_{\text{red}}\to (A_{g})_{\text{red}},$ for
$\sqrt{(g)}\subset\sqrt{(f)}$ is the map induced by the map $A_f\to A_g.$
Thus $(\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)})_{\text{red}}$ forms a $\mathcal{B}$-sheaf
on the basis $\mathcal{B}$ of basic open sets, and in fact it is the same
$\mathcal{B}$-sheaf given by $f_*\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A/\mathcal{R})}$
above. Thus by corollary $2$ above we have that
$(\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)})_{\text{red}}^{+}$ is isomorphic to
$f_*\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A/\mathcal{R})}.$

Suppose now that $X$ is an arbitrary scheme and $\{U_{\alpha}\}$ is an affine
open cover of $X$ with $U_{\alpha}\cong\text{Spec}(A_\alpha).$ By our work
above we see that
$(U_{\alpha})_{\text{red}}\cong\text{Spec}((A_\alpha)_{\text{red}})$ for each
$\alpha.$ The sheaves $(\mathcal{O}_X|_{U_\alpha})_{\text{red}}$ agree on
basic affine open sets and thus on intersections. Therefore they glue to a
sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$. Moreover,
for each $\alpha$ we see that $\mathcal{F}|_{U_\alpha}$ is clearly equal to
the sheaf
$((\mathcal{O}_X)_{\text{red}})|_{U_\alpha}$ given in the problem statement.
Thus $\mathcal{F}\cong(\mathcal{O}_X)_{\text{red}}.$ The maps of affine
schemes
$$
    (U_\alpha,\mathcal{O}_X)\cong\text{Spec}(A_\alpha)\to\text{Spec}((A_\alpha)_{\text{red}})\cong
    (U_\alpha,(\mathcal{O}_{X})_{\text{red}})
$$
also agree on intersections and hence glue to a map $X\to X_{\text{red}}.$
The map $X\to X_{\text{red}}$ is a homeomorphism as it is a homeomorphism on
each $U_\alpha.$

**2.3.c.** 
We define the morphism $g:X\to Y_{\text{red}}$ by
$g(\mathfrak{p})=h^{-1}(f(\mathfrak{p}))$, where
$h:Y_{\text{red}}\to Y$ is the morphism from part (b). Note that $h$ is a
homeomorphism by part (b), so $g$ makes sense as function and is a
continuous map of topological spaces.
$$
\xymatrix{
    X\ar[r]^{f}\ar[dr]_{g} & Y\\
     & Y_{\text{red}} \ar[u]^{h}
}
$$
To simplify notation let us identify the topological
spaces $|Y|$ and $|Y_{\text{red}}|$ so the morphism $h:Y\to Y_{\text{red}}$
gives a map
$h^{\#}:\mathcal{O}_{Y}\to(\mathscr{O}_Y)_{\text{red}}.$
We also have the map $f^{\#}:\mathcal{O}_Y\to f_*(\mathcal{O}_X)$ given by the
morphism $f.$
Thus to complete our construction of a morphism $g$ with the desired properties
it suffices to show that there exists
a pullback map $g^{\#}:\mathscr{O}_{Y_{\text{red}}}\to g^*\mathscr{O}_X$ such
that $f^{\#}=g^{\#}\circ h^{\#}.$

Observe that for $U\subseteq X$ open we have pullback morphism
$f^{\#}(U):\mathscr{O}_Y(U)\to f_*\mathscr{O}_X(U)=\mathscr{O}_X(f^{-1}(U))$.
$$
\xymatrix{
    \mathscr{O}_{Y}(U) \ar[d]_{h^{\#}(U)}\ar[dr]^{f^{\#}(U)}
        & \\
    (\mathscr{O}_{Y})_{\text{red}}(U) \ar[r]_{g^{\#}(U)}
        & f_*\mathscr{O}_X(U).
}
$$
Moreover, since $\mathscr{O}_X$ is reduced, $\mathscr{O}_X(f^{-1}(U))$ is
reduced. So the kernel of $f^{\#}(U)$ must contain the nilradical of
$\mathscr{O}_Y(U)$. Thus it contains the kernel of $h^{\#}(U):
\mathscr{O}_Y(U)\to\mathscr{O}_{Y_{\text{red}}}(U)$. So there exists a
unique homomorphism $g^{\#}(U):\mathscr{O}_{Y_{\text{red}}}(U)\to
f_*\mathscr{O}_X$ such that $f^{\#}(U)=g^{\#}(U)\circ h^{\#}(U).$
The diagram also commutes with restriction $U\to V$ for $V\subseteq U$ and therefore
defines a morphism $g^{\#}:\mathscr{O}_Y\to f_*\mathscr{O}_X$ such
that $f^{\#}=g^{\#}\circ h^{\#}.$
With our identification of $|Y|$ and $|Y_{\text{red}}|$ we have
that $f_*\mathscr{O}_X=g_*\mathscr{O}_X.$
Thus our construction above defines a morphism
$g^{\#}:(\mathscr{O}_{Y})_{\text{red}}\to
g_*\mathscr{O}_X$ that gives a local homomorphism of local rings and thus
$(g,g^{\#})$ define a morphism of schemes.

**2.4.** Let us first show the result for affine schemes (this is actually
already done in Hartshorne in proposition 2.3c).

Suppose that $\varphi:A\to B$ is a ring homomorphism. Then we may define a map
$f:\text{Spec}(B)\to\text{Spec}(A)$ by
$\mathfrak{p}\mapsto\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p}).$ Observe that
$f^{-1}(V(\mathfrak{a}))=V(\varphi(\mathfrak{a}))$ so $f$ is continuous.
Observe that for $D(g)\subset\text{Spec}(A)$ we have
$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)}(D(g))\cong A_f.$ Moreover,
$$
    \begin{aligned}[t]
        f_*\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(B)}(D(g))
            &=\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(B)}(f^{-1}(D(g))\\
            &=\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(B)}(D(\varphi(g)))\\
            &\cong B_{\varphi(g)}.
    \end{aligned}
$$
We therefore define $f^{\#}(D_f):A_f\to B_{\varphi(g)}$ to be the map induced
by $\varphi:A\to B.$ These glue to define a morphism
$f^{\#}:\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(A)}\to f_*\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(B)}$ with
$f^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A))=\varphi.$

In order to show that $\varphi$ defines a morphism of schemes
it remains to show that
$f^{\#}_{f(\mathfrak{p})}:\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(A),f(\mathfrak{p})}\to
\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(B),\mathfrak{p}}$ is a local homomorphism of local
rings for each prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq B.$ Observe that
$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(A),f(\mathfrak{p})}\cong A_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})},$
$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec}(B),\mathfrak{p}}\cong B_{\mathfrak{p}},$ and
$f^{\#}_{f(\mathfrak{p})}:A_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})}\to B_{\mathfrak{p}}$
is given by $s/t\mapsto\varphi(s)/\varphi(t).$ Thus
$$
    \begin{aligned}[t]
    (f^{\#}_{f(\mathfrak{p})})^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}_{\mathfrak{p}})&=
        \{s/t\in A_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})} \, : \,
        \varphi(s)/\varphi(t)\in\mathfrak{m}_{\mathfrak{p}}\}\\
        &=\{s/t\in A_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})} \, : \,
            s\in\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})\}\\
        &=\mathfrak{m}_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})}.
    \end{aligned}
$$
So $f^{\#}_{f(\mathfrak{p})}$ is a local homomorphism of local rings for each
$\mathfrak{p}\in\text{Spec}(B)$ and $f^{\#}$ is a morphism of schemes.

Suppose conversely that $f:\text{Spec}(B)\to\text{Spec}(A)$ is a morphism of
schemes. The first part of our work above shows that the homomorphism
$f^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A)):A\to B$ determines the morphism $f^{\#}.$ Moreover,
since $f^{\#}$ is a morphism of locally ringed spaces we must have
$(f^{\#}_{f(\mathfrak{p})})^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}_{\mathfrak{p}})
=\mathfrak{m}_{f({\mathfrak{p}})}.$ But the map
$f^{\#}_{f(\mathfrak{p})}:A_{f(\mathfrak{p})}\to B_{\mathfrak{p}}$
is just the localization of the global map
$f^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A)):A\to B$ at $f(\mathfrak{p}).$ Therefore
$f^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A))^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})=f(\mathfrak{p}).$
Thus the map $f$ is also determined by the homomorphism
$f^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A)).$ Hence there is a
bijection
$$
    \text{Hom}(\text{Spec}(B),\text{Spec}(A))\cong\text{Hom}(A,B).
$$

Now suppose that $X$ is an arbitrary scheme and
$\varphi:A\to\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)$ is a homomorphism.
Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an affine open cover of $X.$ The map
$\varphi:A\to\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)$ composed with the
restriction map
$\text{res}_{X,U_\alpha}:\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)\to\Gamma(U_\alpha,\mathscr{O}_X)$
is a ring homomorphism $\text{res}_{X,U_\alpha}\circ\varphi:A\to\Gamma(U_\alpha,
\mathscr{O}_X).$ Therefore $\text{res}_{X,U_\alpha}\circ\varphi$
determines a unique morphism of affine schemes
$f_\alpha:U_\alpha\to\text{Spec}(A).$
Now let $\alpha,\beta$ be distinct indexes. We observe that $f_\alpha|_{U_\alpha\cap
U_\beta}=f_\beta|_{U_\alpha\cap U_\beta}$ because for each affine open set
$V\subset U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ we have
$(f_\alpha|_V)^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A))=\text{res}_{X,V}\circ\varphi$,
$(f_\beta|_V)^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A))=\text{res}_{X,V}\circ\varphi$,
and we know that since $V$ is affine
these ring homomorphisms
uniquely
determine $f_\alpha|_V$ and $f_\beta|_V.$ Thus the $f_\alpha$ glue
to a morphism of schemes $f:X\to\text{Spec}(A)$ corresponding to
the homomorphism $\varphi.$

The argument above also shows that any morphism $f:X\to\text{Spec}(A)$ is determined
by $f^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A)):A\to\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)$ since each morphism
of affine schemes
$f|_{U_\alpha}$ is determined by $\text{res}_{X,U_\alpha}\circ
f^{\#}(\text{Spec}(A)).$ Thus there is a bijection
$$
    \text{Hom}(X,\text{Spec}(A))\cong\text{Hom}(A,\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)).
$$

**2.18.a.** Recall that the nilradical of $A$ is the intersection of all prime
ideals in $A.$ Therefore $f$ is nilpotent if and only if $f$ is contained in
all prime ideals of $A,$ i.e., if and only if $D(f)=\emptyset.$

**2.18.b.** Let $g\in A.$ Then the map $f^{\#}(D(g)):\mathscr{O}_X(D(g))\to
f_*\mathscr{O}_Y(D(g))$ is in fact the map $A_{g}\to B_{\varphi(g)}$ induced by
$\varphi:A\to B.$ Therefore each of these maps is injective and hence $f^{\#}$
is injective as a map of sheaves since it is injective on each basic open set.
