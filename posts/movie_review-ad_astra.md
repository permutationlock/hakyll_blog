Ad Astra is a very slow movie in the best way. It is quite unlike the other
space movies released in recent years, I'm talking the likes of
The Martian or Interstellar. It's pacing places it more along the lines of
Blade Runner or 2001
A Space Odyssey. The plot follows a man who must venture into space to search
for his father who left earth almost thirty years earlier. Through this plot
the film studies, among other things,
the way that humans seek escape and fall into obsession in search of meaning
and happiness.

My only major complaint with the movie is it's use
of voice over lines; voice overs are almost never a positive addition. I would
love to have a cut without Brad Pitt's
inner monologue (see Bladerunner). Also, I feel that "To the
Stars" would have been a better title than the Latin translation, and a title
change could
have really helped with viewership.

Recommended if you are looking for something different in the Sci-Fi genre.
