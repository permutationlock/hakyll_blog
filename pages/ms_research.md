A 2004 article by Olivier Wittenberg (1) describes an elliptic surface
$\mathcal{E}/\mathbb{Q}$ and a transcendental $2$-torsion element $A$
in the Brauer group $\text{Br}(\mathcal{E})$ such that the Brauer-Manin set
associated to $A$ is properly contained in the adelic surface, i.e.,
$\mathcal{E}\left(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}}\right)^{A}
\subsetneq\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}})$. In fact, the two torsion part
of the Brauer group of $\mathcal{E}$ modulo constant classes is spanned by $A$
as an $\mathbb{F}_2$-vector space and hence Wittenberg provides an example of a
transcendental Brauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation.

For my masters thesis my adviser and I hope to adapt the techniques used in
Wittenberg's construction to
instead consider a surface possessing a fibration in degree $4$ curves.
Specifically, we consider surfaces whose generic fiber is isomorphic to
a quartic homogeneous
space associated an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$. Many of
the
geometric arguments from Wittenberg's work transfer identically as each surface
we consider will be isomorphic to the associated elliptic surface 
over $\mathbb{C}.$
In this way we hope to find a corresponding Brauer-Manin obstruction
to rational points as, unlike elliptic surfaces, the surfaces we
discuss will not
generally contain rational points.
