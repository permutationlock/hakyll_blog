I am a math grad student at
[Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/math.html)
in Vancouver, supervised by
[Nils Bruin](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~nbruin/index.shtml).
I am originally from Fairbanks, Alaska.

### Interests

[algebraic and arithemetic geometry](http://www.sfu.ca/math/research/algebraic-and-arithmetic-geometry1.html).
