I am a math grad student at
[Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/math.html)
in Vancouver, supervised by
[Nils Bruin](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~nbruin/index.shtml).
I am originally from Fairbanks, Alaska.

### Research

I am part of the
SFU [algebraic and arithemetic geometry group](http://www.sfu.ca/math/research/algebraic-and-arithmetic-geometry1.html).
In particular, I am interested in Galois cohomology and rational points on varieties.
[Here](/pages/ms_research.html) is a brief outline of what I am currently
working on.

Previously I studied computer science at the University of Alaska. My
masters work focused on
[path $3$-coloring algorithms for plane graphs](/posts/path_3_coloring_plane_graphs.html).
