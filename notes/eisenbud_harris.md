Here are my exercise solutions and notes for the beginning
of Eisenbud and Harris's *The Geometry of Schemes*.

Let $R$ be a ring and $\mathfrak{p}\subset R$ a prime ideal. Recall that
we define $R_{\mathfrak{p}}=\{a/b \ : \ a\in R, b\in R-\mathfrak{p}\}$, i.e.,
$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is the localization of $R$ with respect to the
multiplicative set $R-\mathfrak{p}.$

**1-1.**

 (a) $\text{Spec}(Z)=\{(0)\} \cup \{(p) \ : \ p \ \text{prime}\}$;
 (b) $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})=\{(0)\}$ (note $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ is a field);
 (c) $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z})=\{(2),(3)\}$ (note $(0)$ is not prime
since $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$ is not an integral domain);
 (d) $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}_{(3)})=\{(0),(3)\}$;
 (e) $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x])=\{(0)\}\cup\{(x-a) \ : \ a\in\mathbb{C}\}$;
 (f) Recall the prime ideals of $R/I$ are precisely the quotients of prime
ideals $J\supseteq I.$ Thus $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2))=\{(0),(x)\}.$

**I-2.** Note that $15$ sends an element $x$ of $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ to
$\overline{15}\in\kappa(x)=\mathbb{Z}/x.$ Thus $15$ takes the value
$\overline{1}$ in $\kappa(7)$ and the value $\overline{0}$ in $\kappa(5).$

**I-3.a.** This follows since the map $p(x)\mapsto p(a)$ defines an isomorphism
$\kappa((x-a))\to \mathbb{C}.$

**I-3.b.**
Let $V\subset\mathbb{A}^n(K).$ The maximal ideals of $K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ are
$(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n)$ for all points $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in\mathbb{A}^n(K).$
Thus the maximal ideals of $R=\Gamma(V)=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I(V)$ are the images
of these ideals under the natural map $K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\to R$ and correspond
the points of $V.$ Moreover, for a point $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in V$ the map $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto
f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ is an isomorphism $\Gamma(V)\mapsto K.$
Therefore given a polynomial $f\in R$ we have
$f(\mathfrak{p})=f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ where $\mathfrak{p}$ is the maximal ideal
corresponding to the point $(a_1,\ldots,a_n).$

**I-4.a.**
The points of $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x])$ are the ideals generated by irreducible polynomials,
which in $\mathbb{C}[x]$ are the polynomials $x-a.$
Thus the closed points of $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x])$ are precisely the maximal
ideals, i.e., the points corresponding to "actual points" in $\mathbb{C}.$ For
a point $(x-a)$ to be open we would have some ideal $(f)\subset C[x]$ such that
$(x-b)\supset (f)$ for all $b\ne a$ and $(x-a)\not\supset (f)$; this is clearly
impossible, since $f$ would then have an infinite number of distinct factors.

**I-4.b.** The localization $K[x]_{(x)}$ is a DVR with uniformizing parameter $x.$
Thus it has prime ideals $(0)$ and $(x)$, i.e.,
$\text{Spec}(K[x]_{(x)})=\{(0),(x)\}.$ The closed sets are precisely
$\emptyset,\{(x)\},\{(0),(x)\}.$

**I-5.a.** Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a sheaf on $X.$ We may pick $\mathscr{F}(\{0\})$ and
$\mathscr{F}(\{1\})$ to be arbitrary sets. Then $\mathscr{F}(\{0,1\})$ is
the set consisting of a unique $f$ for each distinct $f_0\in\mathscr{F}(\{0\})$
and $f_1\in\mathscr{F}(\{1\})$ such that $f|_{\{0\}}=f_0$ and $f|_{\{1\}}=f_1.$
If we take $R=\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$, then $\text{Spec}(R)=\{(2),(3)\}$
and the closed sets are $\emptyset,\{(2)\},\{(3)\},\{(2),(3)\}$, i.e., every
subset is closed. Thus the topology is discrete as desired.

**I-5.b.** If we take $R=K[x]_{(x)}$ then $\text{Spec}(R)$ has the desired topology
(see exercise 1-4).

**1-6.** Let $\pi:E\to X$ be a vector bundle over a topological space $X.$
Let $\mathscr{F}$ be the sheaf of sections of $\pi$ on $X$ and let
$\mathscr{G}$ be the sheaf of continuous functions on $X.$ Then
$\mathscr{F}(U)$ is a $\mathscr{G}(U)$-module for each open subset $U\subseteq
X.$

**I-8.a.**
We will first show that $\pi$ is continuous. Suppose that $U\subseteq X$ is open.
Then
$$
    \pi^{-1}(U)=\{(x,s_x):x\in U, s\in\mathscr{F}(V)\text{ for some open } V\subseteq
    X\}.
$$
But if $s\in\mathscr{F}(V)$ then $t=s|_{V\cap U}\in\mathscr{F}(V\cap U)$
and $t_x=s_x$ for all $x\in U\cap V.$ So we in fact have
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
\pi^{-1}(U) &=\{(x,s_x):x\in U, s\in\mathscr{F}(V)\text{ for some open } V\subseteq U\}\\
    &= \bigcup_{V\subseteq U}\bigcup_{s\in\mathscr{F}(V)}\mathscr{V}(V,s).
\end{aligned}
$$
So $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open and $\pi$ is continuous.

Now we will show that $\sigma$ is a continuous section of $\pi$ over $U.$
By the definition of $\sigma$ we have that $\pi\circ\sigma$ is the identity on
$U$; $x\mapsto (x,s_x)$ under $\sigma$ and $\pi$ projects $(x,s_x)\mapsto x.$
It suffices to show $\sigma^{-1}(\mathscr{V}(V,s))$ is open for each open $V$ and
$s\in\mathscr{F}(V)$ since $\mathscr{V}(V,s)$ form a basis. Observe that
$$
    \sigma^{-1}(\mathscr{V}(V,s))=\{x\in U :
    (x,s_x)\in\mathscr{V}(V,s)\}=\{x\in U : x\in V\}=U\cap V.
$$

**I-8.b.**
For each $x\in U$ pick an open set $W_x=\mathscr{V}(V_x,s^x)$, $V_x\subset U$,
in $\overline{\mathscr{F}}$ containing $\sigma(x).$ Observe that since
$\pi\circ\sigma$ is the identity on $U$, we must have $\sigma^{-1}(W_x)=V_x\cap
U.$ Note that
$\{V_x\}_{x\in U}$ is an open cover of $U.$ Moreover,
if $z\in V_x\cap V_y$, then
$\sigma(z)\in\mathscr{V}(V_x,s^x)\cap\mathscr{V}(V_y,s^y).$ So $s^x|_{V_x\cap
V_y}=s^y|_{V_x\cap V_y}.$ Thus by the sheaf axiom, there exists
$s\in\mathscr{F}(U)$ such that $s|_{V_x}=s^x.$ So $\sigma$ is in fact defined
by $x\mapsto (x,s_x).$

**Note.** So $\mathscr{F}$ is in fact isomorphic to
the sheaf of germs of continuous sections of
$\pi.$

**I-9.**
Suppose that $\varphi(U)$ is injective for each open $U\subset X.$ Let $x\in X$
and $s_x,t_x\in\mathscr{F}_x$ such that $\varphi_x(s_x)=\varphi_x(t_x).$ Then
there exists an open $U$ containing $x$ and $s,t\in \mathscr{F}(U)$ and
$\varphi(U)(s)=\varphi(U)(t).$
But then $s=t$ since $\varphi(U)$ is injective. So $s_x=t_x.$ If $\varphi(U)$
is also surjective for each $U\subset X$, then $\phi_x$ is surjective for each
$x.$

Conversely, suppose that $\varphi_x$ is injective for each $x.$ Suppose that
$U\subset X$ is open and $s,t\in\mathscr{F}(U)$ such that
$\varphi(U)(s)=\varphi(U)(t).$ Then $\varphi_x(s_x)=\varphi_x(t_x)$ for all $x\in
U.$ So $s_x=t_x$ for all $x\in U$ and $s=t.$ So $\varphi(U)$ is injective.

It remains to show that if $\varphi_x$ is bijective for each $x$, then
$\varphi(U)$ is also surjective for each $U.$ Let $s\in\mathscr{G}(U).$ Since each
$\varphi_x$ is surjective for each $x\in U$ there exists an open $V_x\subset U$
containing $x$ and $t^x\in\mathscr{F}(V_x)$ such that
$\varphi(V_x)(t^x)=s|_{V_x}.$ Observe that for each $x,y\in U$ we have $\varphi(V_x\cap
V_y)(t^x)=\varphi(V_x\cap V_y)(t^y).$ But since $\varphi(V_x\cap V_y)$ is
injective, $t^x|_{V_x\cap V_y}=t^y|_{V_x\cap V_y}.$ Thus by the sheaf axiom
there exists $t\in\mathscr{F}(U)$ such that $t|_{V_x}=t^x$ for each $x$, and
hence
$\varphi(U)(t)=s.$
