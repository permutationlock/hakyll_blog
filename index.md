I am a math grad student at
[Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/math.html)
in Vancouver, supervised by
[Nils Bruin](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~nbruin/index.shtml).
I am originally from Fairbanks, Alaska.

### Interests

In mathematics I am mainly interested in
[algebraic and arithemetic geometry](http://www.sfu.ca/math/research/algebraic-and-arithmetic-geometry1.html).
I also like algorithms,
[graphs](/posts/2018-6-15-path-3-coloring-plane-graphs.html}),
codes, cryptography, combinatorial games,
[model theory](http://library.msri.org/books/Book39/files/marker.pdf),
and programming language theory.

Outside of math I like hiking and cycling, and I have been trying to 
learn chess. I also follow the pro scenes for StarCraft 2 and League of
Legends.

### Arithmetic geometry
